OpMode = A program for our robot.

OpModes are required to have 2 method:

init() - runs once when driver presses INIT
loop() - run repeatedly after driver presses PLAY but before STOP

Additionally:

init_loop() - runs repeatedly after driver presses INIT but before PLAY
start() - runs once when the driver presses PLAY
stop() - runs once when the driver presses STOP

@TeleOp Critical - This ensures this will show on the driver station as an OpMode
Any line that start with @ is called an notation
You can choose from @TeleOp() or @Autonomous()
You can give OpMode a name and group otherwise it just uses class name
@Disabled means code will compile but not show up as an OpMode

GAMEPAD AND BASIC MATHS

Buttons on the gamePad are all boolean (pressed/not pressed)
The d-pad is exposed as four buttons
the joysticks have values between 0 and 1 (not pressed / fully pressed)

You have to pressed the "Start" and "A" simultaneously on a gamepad to recognize gamepad 1
and "Start" and "A" simultaneously on a gamepad to recognize gamepad 2
Once the gamepad has been recognized the gamepad icon in the upper right corner of the DS
will be illuminated

private = Can only be seen in the class
default = only that class and other classes in the same package can see them
protected = can only be seen in class, child classes and in the same package
public = It can be seen anywhere
